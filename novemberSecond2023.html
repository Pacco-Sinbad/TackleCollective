                        In all honesty, I hadn't planned on writing an article this week. The reason for that is I just haven't been fishing much. I’ve wanted to go fishing, but there have been plenty of other tasks preventing me from doing so. Another reason for not wanting to talk about fishing is that when I have gone fishing lately I haven't been doing that great. These two topics do require a little bit of discussion though.
					</p>
                    <p>
                        Let's talk about “chores” getting in the way of fishing. Now I know the cliche of having to do the honey-do list before being allowed to pursue a hobby. The reality though is that you should want to have the other parts of your life attended to before you go have fun. This doesn’t mean you need to clear every project off of the to-do list before you get out on the water, but it does mean you shouldn't be letting stuff slide. I have been working on painting my house and with winter just around the corner I have a few projects that need to be done before it freezes. Additionally, I did let some stuff slide when the fishing was really good around here. My wife understood that I was having fun and mental health being as important as it is she agreed to me spending more time doing what I enjoy. The trade-off there is she was at home watching the kids and tending to other small daily tasks. Now that I haven't been fishing I have taken over most of those daily tasks allowing her to do some things that make her happy.

                        This isn't a relationship article in any way shape or form, but there needs to be balance in our lives. I find that I can enjoy my hobbies abundantly more when there isn’t anything nagging me in the back of my mind. However you can achieve that balance, it is important to do so. With that said I encourage you to look at your to-do list and make sure nothing is slipping by.
                    </p>

                        The other reason I gave for not having an interest in talking about fishing lately is that I just haven't been very productive when I have been able to get on the water. This happens to all of us on occasion. Maybe I haven't been paying enough attention to the weather patterns and I've gotten stuck in my old fishing techniques that just aren't relevant at this time. Perhaps I’ve just come into an unlucky streak and the fish aren't interested in what I'm throwing at them. The best thing to do here is not to get down on yourself. Fishing can be tough and sometimes it just isn't fun at all. We have to enjoy the chase though. That is crucial to enjoying this sport. I definitely overreact a bit to getting skunked. I question if I have any idea of what I'm doing, if I should even bother anymore, and that isn't healthy. I think this feeling stems from only having a limited amount of time on the water and wanting to make the most of it. When we only get maybe four hours every week or two on the water, it can be demoralizing when they aren't productive. I have to remember that we aren't just out there to catch fish but to absorb the entire experience of being in nature.

                        I am in store for a pretty long break in my fishing heading into late fall and winter. Between the yard work, holidays, kids, and a litany of other distractions I just won't have blocks of time to spend on the water. This is a good thing in my eyes. I will just be that much more excited when we get to ice fishing season to walk out on that frozen lake, pop up my tent, and drill my holes. We shouldn't look at a break, intentional or not, as a bad thing. I doubt anybody reading this is getting paid to fish. If you are that's great, but for those of us that aren't, take this break as a chance to recalibrate. When you get back to your honey hole you'll be all the more excited to be there.

                        I will do my best to keep throwing out an article each week even though I won't be fishing much in the coming months. There are plenty of things we can do related to fishing even when we aren't on the water. I'll take this chance to go over some of the stuff I do off the water. Make sure you follow The Tackle Collective on <a  href="https://www.instagram.com/the.tackle.collective/">Instagram</a> and <a  href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61551762376953">Facebook</a> so that you don't miss when those articles come out. Until next week, tight lines and full coolers!
