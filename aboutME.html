					<p>As you may have guessed by the heading of this article I am the author of The Tackle Collective. But why am I the author of this online article? While taking a break from formal work to care for my young children I decided to further my education, leading me to web development. One struggle I think many budding web developers encounter is finding a project they can sink some time into and make their own. The Tackle Collective may not be the most ambitious of projects when it comes to displaying my prowess in typing out lines of code but it is a project I am passionate about.</p>
                    <p>I have become an avid fisherman as I've gotten older. I think part of that is being able to take my children with me or the solitude I can find when fishing alone. As with any hobby I have become interested in, my wife can attest to this, I dove in 100%. That means collecting probably too much tackle and definitely purchasing a few too many rods, but it also meant exploring the DIY part of fishing. There are many things you can craft for yourself. One of the most popular DIY subjects when it comes to fishing is lure-making. There are hundreds of large brands of lures lining the aisles of our favorite box and outdoor stores. What's more interesting though is the thousands of people making lures in their garages and basements. Many of them started making lures simply to catch a fish on something they made themselves. That seems to evolve, often enough, into selling a few on the side to buddies that saw them catch a fish on a lure they hadn't seen before. Even I have dabbled in tying flies to use while trolling for salmon on Lake Michigan.</p>
                    <p>My goal with The Tackle Collective is to put these small lure makers, and other small businesses like tackle shops and custom painters, in the spotlight. A lot of these craftspeople have their Instagrams and Facebook profiles where they show off their lures. At times though, the exposure to the rest of the fishing community can be lost. As we all know these sites have an algorithm and this can play against us. Maybe by compiling interviews with these wonderful people and sharing their stories through my articles, I can expand the reach of a few of these makers. Hopefully, I can help some of them tell their story and passion for fishing. Maybe I can help a few readers find a lure or bait shop they hadn't known about. In the end, I just want to celebrate the people in our sport whose passion goes beyond throwing a line in the water but has become a bigger part of their life adventure.</p>
