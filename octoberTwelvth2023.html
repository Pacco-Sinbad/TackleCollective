				<article >
					<p>Last week I discussed some things we can do to ensure a higher probability of success when exploring new bodies of water. If you haven’t read that article yet, I recommend checking it out <a href="octoberFifth2023.html">here.</a> This week I want to quickly cover a few pre-trip preparations to make sure we get the most out of any trip but especially trips to unknown fishing locations. So, that means we won't be hitting the water today, but that doesn't make the info discussed today any less important.
					</p>
                    <p>The first thing we need to do when getting ready to fish any body of water but is even more important when going somewhere we haven't before is letting somebody know. Preferably you should let two separate parties know where you will be and how long you expect to be there. Safety comes first, always. If something unfortunate happens to you that you can’t return to shore or hike back out, having someone expect you to return is a good safety net. There are still plenty of areas where there is no cell phone coverage and events can occur that render our phone useless even where there is coverage. Cell phones and other electronics are great tools but they are unreliable and a backup plan should always be in place. It is a good idea to leave a detailed plan for people that includes where you will be parking, what direction you plan to head from there, and if necessary directions to the location if it is a bit off the grid.	
					</p>
                    <p>Speaking of planning, and concerning fishing, set up a plan of action for when you get to the water. Don't go with your entire tackle box and plan to figure it out when you get there. Doing that will ensure you have a less productive day than if you had put together a game plan for how you want to fish the area. The first thing I do is think about patterns that have been working in other locations. Every body of water is different but, assuming you aren't traveling across the country, weather patterns tend to hold fairly consistently.
					</p>
					<p>From there it is a good idea to have two or three backup patterns that you can correlate to the area you are fishing. Pick out patterns and lures that match the terrain and bottom makeup of the body of water. Are there a lot of submerged weeds, or grass, or are there a lot of coarse rocky areas, what is the water clarity?  Take the info you gathered while scouting online and form a plan, and when you get there stick to that plan. That doesn't mean to keep doing something that isn't productive but stick to your planned patterns until you get on the bite or can rule those techniques out for that day. This is why it's important to have a backup plan too. You don't want to be out there just to find out what you thought would be the key pattern isn’t producing and then rummaging around your tackle box trying to figure out what to do next.
					</p>
					<p>Another pre-trip consideration should be packing. This is an extremely obvious statement but having everything organized the night before will ensure you get where you want to on time or even better early. That way you leave room for unexpected issues be it with a boat or access. This also allows you to make sure you are bringing everything you want. It's bad enough to forget something on any normal fishing day, but it's arguably worse when you forget something and you are somewhere you don't know.
					</p>
					<p>I hope you were able to find some useful information in this week's article. I promise next week I will focus on what we need to do when we are on the water when fishing in a new location. I firmly believe that everything we do leading up to fishing makes the experience better both in productivity and time spent.
