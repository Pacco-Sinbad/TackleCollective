				<article >
					<p>Today is the day. We are going to get on the water and start fishing. The last two weeks we covered <a href="octoberFifth2023.html">scouting</a> and <a href="octoberTwelvth2023.html">preparing</a> for our trip to a new body of water. You can find those two articles at their respective links above or by visiting the archives page <a href="archivedArticlesTable.html">here.</a> Now we can start talking about the steps we can take while on the water to ensure as much success as possible.
					</p>
                    <p>The very first thing that you need to do is to get there early. I’m not saying you need to be there at three in the morning when it's still pitch black out. I am saying that you should arrive probably an hour to two hours earlier than you would normally start fishing. That could mean in the early AM or it could mean two in the afternoon. The key is to allow yourself time to explore the area without worrying about your line in the water. On a boat, you can travel to the different areas you marked as points of interest, and for shore fishermen, you get a chance to walk the shoreline. This is where all the pre-scouting at home comes in handy. You get to quickly check all these spots and figure out how to implement the game plan you set up.
					</p>
                    <p>The next benefit of arriving early is being able to fish an area and determine if it's going to be productive. This assumes you are going to be on the water for a while, but if you figure out in the first hour that an area isn't doing what you thought it would but you arrived an hour or more early, you have plenty of time to try another spot. This doesn't mean you throw out the game plan. I just mean to move to another area and try out your predicted patterns. You are eliminating unproductive water.
					</p>
					<p>Now, once you find an area that is working and a pattern that is working, don’t sit there all day. We are trying to learn the area. Generally leaving fish to find fish is frowned upon. I’ll be the first one to say that I’ve been burned leaving productive fishing just to get skunked the rest of the day. There is a benefit to even going without a fish for the rest of the day though. It tells you that the other areas you tried may not be holding fish at that time. Or that certain patterns are working better at different depths. By no means am I saying you should catch one fish and move on. Definitely fish a good spot for a while but don't burn it out and leave the rest of the water unexplored. That segways into the next topic.
					</p>
					<p>Don’t burn your spot. You have put all this work into finding a great fishing spot. You've spent hours scouting online. You've taken the time to get there early. You set up a game plan and stuck to it. All of this has led you to fish. Don’t go on the internet and tell everyone. There are undoubtedly other anglers who have found that same spot after putting in the work. You would be doing them and yourself a disservice to tell the world “The fish are all over here!”, ending up ruining a spot you can come back to time and time again
					</p>
					<p>Let's say you spent the entire day fishing and found nothing. You got completely skunked. Assuming you stuck to your plans A, B, and maybe C, that doesn't rule the area out. Take all the information you got from the outing and come back as soon as you can with your next game plan. Part of new water fishing is the puzzle of figuring out fish and finding out how to catch them. Go to another spot that you know and get on some fish, but don't abandon this new water. If you've done all this work and are sure there are fish in the water, you owe it to yourself to figure them out. Some of the best most exhilarating days of fishing are the ones where I return to a lake I had previously gotten skunked at and come at it with a whole new plan to end up completely slamming some fish. So get back there and reap everything you've sowed.
					</p>
					<p>There is more that could be covered here but I think I've touched on some of the most important parts of the fishing day. If you think I've left something important out, please shoot me a message over on Facebook or Instagram, or leave a comment. I hope what I covered today will help you out on the water in the future. Thanks for reading and make sure to check out the page on <a  href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61551762376953">Facebook</a> and <a  href="https://www.instagram.com/the.tackle.collective/">Instagram</a> to leave any comments and so you don't miss the next article where we wrap up the new water series. Until then, full coolers and tight lines.
