					<p>Taking on a new location is always a nice change of pace that can present a fun challenge. Learning new fishing locations is also a good way to spread out your pressure on the productive spots you’ve located to keep from burning them out. That being said, there are a few steps we can take to ensure the experience is enjoyable and productive the first time and in the future.
					</p>
                    <p>It is crucial to get at least a vague idea of the layout of the body of water you are heading to. Whether you will be fishing a ten acre lake from shore or a three hundred acre lake from a boat, knowledge of the shape and contour of the area will speed up the learning process exponentially in addition to providing added safety. Scouting doesn’t even have to be walking around the area you will be fishing. You can start planning from home utilizing google maps.</p>
                    <p>Pull up google maps and navigate over to the body of water you plan to fish. Make sure you switch over to satellite view. Now you can see the shape of the lake, but you can also identify areas with shore access, and areas with heavy shore cover. Knowing the general shape of the lake can help you identify the areas of highest probability to hold fish. Look for points and bays and make a mental note of them. Even better, if you can, print a screenshot of the map than you can bring with you. You could definitely pull up the map on your phone but I personally try to avoid having my phone out around water. Google maps can even give you a general idea of the depths of the water. Darker water will typically be deeper and lighter shallower. This is very general though and there are much better ways to get an idea of the varying depths.</p>
					<p>Utilizing bathymetric maps is a must if you are on the shore or in a boat. These maps give detailed information about the variable depths of a body of water. They read by marking changes in depth indicated by lines outlining the different areas. Typically they show changes of five foot increments. Lines spaced close together show steep drops and inversely lines spaced far apart show flats and gradual changes. Circles on a map can show deep bowls and humps. This is obviously helpful for boat anglers but how do those of us on the short utilize the information from these maps? Knowing the steep drops and points that the shore contours don’t point to can put you in areas of higher probability to hold fish quicker, as opposed to fishing the entirety of the shore line.</p>
					<p>This is all a great start to learning a new body of water before ever getting into a vehicle, or taking a step out of the house. We can’t catch any fish from the comfort of our couches though. Next week I will continue the series, discussing a few more provisions we can make before hitting the banks.</p>
