				<article >
					<p>The last three weeks' articles have consisted of pre-trip prep and actively fishing a new body of water. This week isn’t going to go into too much detail on advice or the dos or don'ts. This week isn’t going to be all that long of an article either. My goal this week is to encourage you to step outside of your comfort zone and try something new.
					</p>
                    <p>If you are reading this article then without a doubt you enjoy fishing more than probably ninety percent of other anglers. That doesn't mean that you can't get burnt out on fishing though. I am the type of person who goes head first one hundred percent into anything that I do. This can lead to burnout in quick order. I find that whenever I get to the point where I'm not excited to wake up at five in the morning to load up the truck and head to the water is exactly the time I need to change something up. Sometimes this change is a different target species but more often than not it means just finding a new place to fish. 
					</p>
                    <p>I have found all kinds of new spots for different species of fish by venturing out to newer water. I have my bass lakes, blue gill lakes, and streams for trout. I will change it up depending on the time of year to target other species on different rivers. There is just so much in the world of fishing that can keep my interest I never really have time to be bored. Except for ice fishing, but I'm okay with that kind of being bored. This obsession has led to an extensive collection of equipment but let's be honest. If we didn't spend the money on fishing stuff we would spend it elsewhere. At least we can say we are putting all the money into one hobby even if that hobby is as multifaceted as fishing.
					</p>
					<p>This is all to say that you shouldn't let yourself get bored of your hobby. There is no reason to take a break from fishing because of burnout. There are so many places to explore and experiences to be had that you could fish for eight hours a day and have only covered a fraction of the opportunities around you. So get out there or get on Google Maps or ask around in one of your fishing groups and just find something new to try. Sometimes you will try something and it will be a dud but you might find a renewed passion for the sport or deepen it even further.
					</p>
					<p>I hope you enjoyed reading through this four-part series. If you haven’t read the other three articles, I encourage you to head over to the archives page and give them a quick read. If this article touched home in some way then those articles may give you a little extra help in exploring other opportunities around you. I will be back next week with another article so be sure to follow me on <a  href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61551762376953">Facebook</a> and <a  href="https://www.instagram.com/the.tackle.collective/">Instagram</a> so you don't miss it. Until then, tight lines and full coolers!
